# Research

My research interests include ergodic theory, dynamical systems, stochastics, and the use of dynamical thinking for interdisciplinary scientific research efforts. I am a member of the [ergodic theory and dynamical systems research group](http://www.math.uh.edu/dynamics/DynSystGroup/) at the University of Houston.

My recent ergodic-theoretic efforts have focused on nonstationary dynamics and on infinite-dimensional systems. On the algebraic side, I have worked recently on symbolic systems over infinite alphabets.

I collaborate with the Bennett Lab on biodesign projects. We use the tools of synthetic biology, computational biology, and microfluidic devices to advance our understanding of biological systems, especially genetic networks. This collaboration has raised interesting mathematical questions, including theoretical and computational aspects of large deviations for stochastic systems with delay.
